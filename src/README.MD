# 🚀 Node.js Project Template 

This repository provides a **base Node.js project template**, designed with clean architecture, modular folder structure, and best practices for scalable backend development. It's ideal for kickstarting your next Node.js + Express application.

> 🛠️ Feel free to modify this template as per your project needs.

## 📦 Explanation of Key Directories

### `src/config/`

Contains all setup and configuration logic. For example:

* `server-config.js`: Initializes environment variables using `dotenv`.
* Logging or monitoring library setup (like Winston, Morgan).

### `src/routes/`

Registers the application's routes and attaches middlewares and controllers.

### `src/middlewares/`

Interceptors for incoming requests. Common use cases include:

* Input validation
* Authentication & authorization
* Logging and error tracking

### `src/controllers/`

Final request handlers before business logic is executed.

* Receive request data
* Call appropriate service methods
* Format and return the response

### `src/services/`

Implements **business logic**. These functions process data and interact with repositories.

### `src/repositories/`

Handles **database communication**. Write all raw SQL or ORM (e.g., Sequelize) queries here.

### `src/utils/`

Reusable helper methods, custom error classes, constants, etc.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3000  # or any port of your choice
```

### 4. Initialize Sequelize (if using Sequelize ORM)

Run this command from the root directory:

```bash
npx sequelize init
```

This will create:

* `migrations/`
* `seeders/`
* `config/config.json`

### 5. Configure database

In `config/config.json`, add your database credentials:

```json
"development": {
  "username": "<your-username>",
  "password": "<your-password>",
  "database": "<your-db-name>",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "dialect": "mysql"  // or "postgres", "mariadb", etc.
}
```

> For **test** or **production** environments, replace `host` with your remote DB URL.

## 🚀 Run the Project

To start the server in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices Followed

* Clean and modular project structure
* Separation of concerns
* Environment-based configuration
* Extensible middleware and error handling
* Scalable for larger applications

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements (Optional)

* Add Swagger for API documentation
* Integrate ESLint and Prettier
* Setup centralized error handling
* Add unit and integration tests
